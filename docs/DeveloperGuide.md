### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delc 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ClientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Client` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a client).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores WealthVault data i.e., all `Client` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueClientList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Client` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Client` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Client` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Client

The `addc` command adds a client from WealthVault based on the specified index.

The Class Diagram of a Client can be [seen in the diagram above](#model-component).

#### Implementation

The `addc` command adds a client at a given index. The following sequence diagrams  
illustrate how this process flows through the logic component:

<puml src="diagrams/AddClientSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" width="650" />

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the `AddClientCommand` class interacts with  
model components to remove a client from WealthVault:

<puml src="diagrams/AddClientSequenceDiagram-Client.puml" width="600" />

As seen above, the `execute` method adds the `Client` to WealthVault. If the index is invalid, an error is thrown.

### Add Policy

The `addp` command adds a policy (tag) to a client's list of policies.

The Class Diagram of a Client can be [seen in the diagram above](#model-component).

#### Implementation

The `addp` command adds a policy to the client at the given index.
The following sequence diagrams illustrate how this process flows through the logic component:

<puml src="diagrams/AddPolicySequenceDiagram.puml" width="650" />

As seen above, the `execute` method adds the `Policy` to the client at the specified index. If the index is invalid, an error is thrown.

### Delete Client

The `delc` command removes a client from WealthVault based on the specified index.

The Class Diagram of a Client can be [seen in the diagram above](#model-component).

#### Implementation

The `delc` command deletes a client at a given index. The following sequence diagrams  
illustrate how this process flows through the logic component:

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteClientSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" width="650" />

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the `DeleteClientCommand` class interacts with  
model components to remove a client from WealthVault:

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteClientSequenceDiagram-Client.puml" width="600" />

As seen above, the `execute` method retrieves the `Client` at the specified index and removes  
it from WealthVault. If the index is invalid, an error is thrown.

### Delete Multiple Clients

The `deleteclientmult` command removes multiple clients from WealthVault based on the specified indices.

#### Implementation

The `deleteclientmult` command deletes multiple clients at given indices. The following sequence diagrams  
illustrate how this process flows through the logic component:

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteClientMultSequenceDiagram.puml" width="650" />

As seen above, the `execute` method retrieves each `Client` at the specified indices and removes  
them from WealthVault. If any index is invalid, an error is thrown.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to specify multiple indices:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `i/` prefix for each index

  - Pros: Clear and explicit format, reduces input errors
  - Cons: Slightly more verbose

- **Alternative 2:** Use space-separated indices
  - Pros: More concise
  - Cons: Higher chance of input errors, less explicit

The current implementation uses Alternative 1 as it provides better clarity and reduces the likelihood of user input errors.

### Delete Policy

The `delp` command removes a policy (tag) from a client's list of policies.

The Class Diagram of a Client can be [seen in the diagram above](#model-component).

#### Implementation

The `delp` command deletes a policy at a given index within a displayed policy list.  
The following sequence diagrams illustrate how this process flows through the logic component:

<puml src="diagrams/DeletePolicySequenceDiagram.puml" width="650" />

As seen above, the `execute` method retrieves the `Policy` at the specified index and removes  
it from the corresponding `Client` object. If the index is invalid, an error is thrown.

### Priority feature

#### Priority Tag

The priority command is built around the `PriorityTag` class, which extends `Tag`.
The PriorityTag constructor does not accept arguments, ensuring that its tagName
is always set to "Priority."

The Class Diagram of a Client can be [seen in the diagram above](#model-component).

#### Implementation

The `PriorityCommand` toggles a clientâ€™s priority status. The following sequence diagrams
illustrate how this process flows through the logic component:

<puml src="diagrams/PrioritySequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" width="650" />

The following sequence diagrams illustrate how the `PriorityCommand` class interacts with
model components to toggle the priority of the user

<puml src="diagrams/PrioritySequenceDiagram-Client.puml" width="600" />

As seen above, the `togglePriority` method creates a new `Client` object
with updated priority. If the `Client` does not have a `PriorityTag`,
`togglePriority` will create a new `Client` with a `PriorityTag` object.
Else, it will filter the `PriorityTag` out of `tags`.
Its operation is modeled below:

<puml src="diagrams/TogglePrioritySequenceDiagram1.puml" width="750" />

<puml src="diagrams/TogglePrioritySequenceDiagram2.puml" width="550" />

### Find-Any Find-All

#### Implementation

As the `findany` and `findall` command performs very similarly. We thought that it made 
the most sense for `FindClientOrCommand` and `FindClientAndClient` to be sibling classes 
(in this case extending from `AbstractFindClientCommand`). The main difference between
the two is that they use different predicates `ContainsAnyKeywordsPredicate` and `ContainsAnyKeywordsPredicate`
which inherits from `AbstractContainsKeywordsPredicate`
Below is a class diagram to demonstrate the relationship of the 3 classes.

<puml src="diagrams/FindCommandsClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the `AbstractFindClientCommand` and hence the
`FindClientOrCommand` and `FindClientAndCommand` class interacts with  
model components to get a filtered list from WealthVault:

<puml src="diagrams/AbstractFindClientCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" width="750" />

### Update Client feature

The `update` command allows users to modify only the contact information (phone, email, address) of a client, without changing their name or tags.

#### Implementation

The `update` command updates a client's contact information at a given index. Unlike the `edit` command which allows changing all client fields, the `update` command is specifically designed to only modify contact information fields (phone, email, address), preserving the client's name and tags.

The `UpdateClientCommand` extends `Command` directly, rather than extending `EditCommand`, to enforce these restrictions. However, it still reuses the `EditClientDescriptor` class to store field values.

The restrictions are implemented in two key places:

1. In the `UpdateClientCommandParser`:

   ```java
   // Only tokenize phone, email, and address prefixes
   ArgumentMultimap argMultimap = ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize(args,
           PREFIX_PHONE, PREFIX_EMAIL, PREFIX_ADDRESS);
   ```

2. In the `createUpdatedClient` method of `UpdateClientCommand`:
   ```java
   return new Client(
           clientToUpdate.getName(),      // Preserve original name
           updatedPhone,
           updatedEmail,
           updatedAddress,
           clientToUpdate.getTags()       // Preserve original tags
   );
   ```

This design allows for a more specialized update command that can be used when users only need to update contact information without risking accidental changes to a client's identity (name) or categorization (tags).

### Sort Priority feature

#### Implementation

The sort priority command allows users to sort clients by their priority status. The following sequence diagram
illustrates how this process flows through the logic component:

<puml src="diagrams/SortPrioritySequenceDiagram.puml" width="650" />

The `SortPriorityCommand` extends the abstract `Command` class and works with the `Model` component to sort clients.
When executed, it calls `Model#sortClientsByPriority()` which internally uses the `UniqueClientList` to sort clients
based on their priority status.

The sorting is implemented in the `UniqueClientList` class, where clients with priority (those with a `PriorityTag`)
are placed before non-priority clients. This is achieved through a comparator that sorts based on the client's
`getPriority()` value.

The command returns a `CommandResult` with a success message once the sorting is complete, and the UI automatically
updates to show the new sorted order of clients.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

**Note:** WealthVault will be referred to generically as Address Book in this section. 

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

- `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
- `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
- `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delc 5` command to delete the 5th client in WealthVault. The `delc` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delc 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `addc n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new client. The `addc` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the client was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify Address Book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `addc n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.

  - Pros: Easy to implement.
  - Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

- **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  - Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delc`, just save the client being deleted).
  - Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Planned Enhancements**
**Team Size:** 5

1. **Case-sensitivity of prefixes:** The current command format only allows prefixes in lowercase
   (e.g. `a/`, `e/`, `n/`, `p/`, `t/`, and not `A/`, `E/`, `N/`, `P/`, `T/`). We plan to consider allowing prefixes to be case-insensitive to make it more convenient for users (e.g.
   let `t/` and `T/` both be considered valid prefixes).


2. **Input validation for policy tags (part 1):** We currently impose restrictions on policy tags to disallow certain symbols (`/` etc).
   However, the restriction might have been excessive. For instance, the user might want to create a policy tag with the name `Policy A/B`,
   which is likely a valid policy name in practice but is disallowed in our current setup. We plan to review the list of symbols allowed,
   to strike a balance between disallowing invalid input and maintaining flexibility for user-defined inputs.


3. **Input validation for policy tags (part 2):** We currently capitalise the first character of every word in the policy tag (e.g. `addp 1 t/policy A` results in `Policy A` policy tag
   being added to the client at index 1, rather than `policy A`), in order to prevent duplicates (e.g. `policy A` and `Policy A` might be the same policy).
   However, this restriction may not always align with user expectations or preferences. For instance, the user might want to create a policy tag named `WholeLife Plan` rather than `Wholelife Plan`.
   We plan to revisit our approach to formatting of policy tag names, to strike a balance between disallowing invalid input and maintaining flexibility for user-defined inputs.


4. **Input validation for phone numbers:** We currently do not check for the validity of phone numbers based on the country code.
   For instance, `+65 12345` is considered despite it being necessary for Singapore phone numbers (country indicated by `+65`) to
   be 8 digits long. We plan to include such checks when validating user input for phone numbers.
